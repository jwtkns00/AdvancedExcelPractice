# Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

In this project, I analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover hidden trends.

# Conclusion
Based on the Data provided, we can come to the conclusions:

1.	The Music category and the Theater category were the two most successful campaigns.
2.	The Food category has the highest fail rate of any of the campaigns.
3.	The higher the campaign goal, the higher the fail rate is.

Limitations based on date provided:

1.	Hard to tell which campaigns, based on sub-category, follow the trend of increased failure due to decreased goals.
2.	Cannot compare dates with sub-categories in order to come up with a formula to solve this problem.

How to overcome said limitation:

1.	A chart that compares specific campaign subcategories and their date with their goal to see what relation it proves.
